This is a project created for the [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com/mathewleland) front end curriculum.

It utilizes the openweathermap API and getting the user IP address to determine location, but also has inputs for other zip codes

This unfortunately DOES NOT work over github pages since the openweathermap API does not support HTTPS requests for free accounts, so if you want to see a demo of the page, it is only available [here](http://mhleland.com/weather.html)
